Features:
- Fast interactive GPU path tracer
- progressive rendering
- support for diffuse, specular (mirror), refractive, acrylic/coat and metal Phong materials
- support for spheres and triangle meshes
- BVH acceleration structure built with SAH (Surface Area Heuristic) and binning
- interactive camera with mouse and keyboard controls
- anti-aliasing
- depth-of-field


Instructions for compiling with Visual Studio 2015:
- Just open CUDA_PT.sln under Visual Studio 2015 and click Build solution. It has been tested under x86 platform. You may need to add glut32.dll and glew32.dll in the solution folder.
